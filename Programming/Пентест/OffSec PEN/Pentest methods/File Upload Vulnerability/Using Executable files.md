### Some websites have a uploading system

So we can use it for our benefits

---
### Testing upload system to vulnerability and uploading our malicious[^1] code

1. We can test uploading system just by uploading to there some types of data(.txt, .jpeg). But main goal of this actions to upload our malicious code.
2. Now if we found out that we can upload more than just txt we can upload for example `php` file([[Programming 1/Пентест/OffSec PEN/Pentest methods/Remote File Inlusion(RFI)|Backdoor]] `php` file from recent methods)
>[!INFO]
>Some websites could have filters for common file extensions(like `php`), so we can change it to less-common PHP file extansions like `.php7` or `phps`
>Another way: We can change letters in file extensions to upper case(Like `.pHP`)

3. Lets confirm that our backdoor successfully executed by using `curl` with command `?cmd=dir` like we did in [[Local File Inclusion (LFI) And Log Poidoning| LFI]]

### Obtaining[^2] a reverse shell to the powerShell

1. Running [[Programming 1/Пентест/OffSec PEN/Tools/NetCat(nc) & Reverse Shell|NetCat]] on port 80
2. Encoding our oneliner and starting it like `cmd=` parameter(For powershell we will do it like [[Programming 1/Пентест/OffSec PEN/Tools/PowerShell|this]])

All Done!!!
