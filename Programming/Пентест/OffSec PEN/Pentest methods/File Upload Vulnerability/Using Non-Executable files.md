### Checking for any other vulns like [[Identifying and exploring directory traversals|directory traversals]]

1. Looking for any familiar files (`admin.php`, `index.php`) using [[Curl|curl]]
	```bash
	curl http://mountaindesserts.com:8000/index.php
	result:
	404 page not found
	```

2. [[Burp Suit]](Checking for relative path vuln)
	1. Uploading some file (Web page)
	2. In `burp suit` moving POST request from HTTP history to repeater
	3. In repeater we can modify `filename` parameter with realtive path to root
		`../../../../../../../test.txt`
		Unfortunately in example it didnt work
		
---

3. [[SSH]]
	1. Creating our own key and adding it to `authorized_keys`
	2. Now we can choose this `authorized_keys` file without uploading it
	3. Using `burp suit` intercepting request and to `filename` parameter adding relative path to to this `authorized_keys
		`../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
	4. Connecting to target's ssh(If we will just try to connect it will give us error because local file known-hosts contains all host keys of previous connections)
		Deleting it (`rm ~/.ssh/known-hosts`)
	5. Connecting via ssh
		```bash
		ssh -p {ssh port} -i {your key name} root(host)@urladress
		```
