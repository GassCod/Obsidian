`Traversals - Обходы`
### Main web site vulnerability we will use 

`https://example.com/cms/login.php?language=en.html`:
 - Here we see that our web application runs in a  subdirectory of the main root
- And also it accepts some file to 

Lets look into this url in more detail:
 - `cms` - the folder we are in
 - `login.php` - exactly file is running. Also it indicates that this web application uses php(By this knowledge we can get some assumptions[^1] how this web application works)
 -  `?language=en.html` - the language parameter with html page as its value

### Folder navigation

[[Programming 1/Пентест/OffSec PEN/Tools/Bash guide(Requires creation)]]

>[!TIP]
We can use regular bash navigation between folders in our web application(`../` to go to the previous folder)
>
> We can put 10 of this `../` to get into root folder

Syntax you need to move between directories:
```bash
/index.php?page=../../../../folder name you want to enter
```

- `?page=` - URL parameter that web application pass information to the server

>[!ATTENTION]
>Websites could sorts this `../` by filters or firewalls because leveraging[^2] this method is so high

We can use `URL Encoding` or `Percenting coding`.

### Receiving SSH host key 

1. Enter the folder with SSH host key:
	 - Enter to home directory `/index.php?page=../../../../../../../home`
	 - Exploring home directory to directories with `.ssh` directory(We need `.ssh` directory, usually contains in some dir in home dir)
	 - Exploring `.ssh` directory to find file with SSH host key(For example `.ssh/id_rsa)
