1. Going collect first 3 artifacts as usual
2. Instead of backing to shoot positions we just go back (until robot can see goal and also far enough to make path to next artifacts easier)
3. Turning robot while going to this position(we can turn it close to goal and then turn to the goal exactly)
4. Then just shooting(We always need the shooter and autoHoodAlighnment turned on.)
5. Then just going to collect next artifacts and turning in parralel
6. *And last move(if i right) we need to go to park pos(Positions inside white lines)*

#### Message: Guys, i created test plan how we can make our autonomous much more faster just by using our auto functions
